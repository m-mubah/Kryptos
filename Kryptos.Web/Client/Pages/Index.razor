        <p class="dark:text-gray-400">
            Cryptography is the art and science of concealing messages to introduce secrecy in information security.
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-gray-400">
            The art of cryptography is considered to be born along with the art of writing.
            As civilizations evolved, human beings got organized in tribes, groups, and kingdoms.
            This led to the emergence of ideas such as power, battles, supremacy, and politics.
            These ideas further fueled the natural need of people to communicate secretly with selective
            recipient which in turn ensured the continuous evolution of cryptography as well.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold dark:text-gray-50">History</h3>
        <div class="dark:text-gray-400">
            The roots of cryptography stem from two civilizations:

                        <h5 class="mb-2 text-2xl font-bold tracking-tight text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Egypt - Heiroglyphics</h5>
                        <p class="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
                            The first known evidence of cryptography can be traced to the use of ‘hieroglyph’.
                            Some 4000 years ago, the Egyptians used to communicate by messages written in hieroglyph.
                            This code was the secret known only to the scribes who used to transmit messages on behalf of the kings.

                        <p class="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
                            The earlier Roman method of cryptography, popularly known as the
                            Caesar Shift Cipher, relies on shifting the letters of a message by an agreed number (three was a common choice),
                            the recipient of this message would then shift the letters back by the same number and obtain the original message.
